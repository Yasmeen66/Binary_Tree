# Binary_Tree

Insertnode function is to insert new node to the binary tree.

In a pre_order traversal, we visit the root node first, then recursively do a preorder traversal of the left subtree, followed by a recursive preorder traversal of the right subtree.

In an in_order traversal, we recursively do an inorder traversal on the left subtree, visit the root node, and finally do a recursive inorder traversal of the right subtree.

In a post_order traversal, we recursively do a postorder traversal of the left subtree and the right subtree followed by a visit to the root node.

Level_order is to print data in level order
